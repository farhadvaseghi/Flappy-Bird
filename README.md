In this repo, we are going to see how to make a flappy bird game in Pygame.
We all are familiar with this game. In this game, the main objective of the player is to gain the maximum points by defending the bird from hurdles.

We will be using Pygame(a Python library) to create this Flappy Bird game. Pygame is an open-source library that is designed for making video games. it helps us to create fully functional games and multimedia programs in python.

## Requirements
To install Pygame, you need to open up your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
After installing Pygame we are ready to create our cool Flappy Bird game.

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/farhadvaseghi/Flappy-Bird.git
cd Flappy-Bird
python main.py
```
